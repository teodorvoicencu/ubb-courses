# ubb-coursesðŸ“–

The aim of this project is to create a friendlier environment for the students to learn during the university.
Our project will enable course material upload and organizing them into bite-sized lessons.
We aim to support uploading images, videos and other lessons formats. We aim to increase student interactivity with features
such as polls, quizzes, and projects such that the students will be able to more easily learn the subjects that matter.

# Project Structure

This project is a mono-repository. It contains both the frontend project and the backend APIs.

## Frontend

The `frontend` folder contains the react application and all the necessary dependencies for this project to work.  
It is written in React with:
* Flow - a library maintained by Facebook for type linting
* `react-redux` - a state-management library to maintain a single source of truth 
* `redux-sagas` - a library to make application side-effects easier to deal with
